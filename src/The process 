Here is my work flow. I divided up the technical test into 3 parts. I am currently between step 6 and 7.

Part 1

        1. Click button and user will get redirected to the authentication page because the first_url wraps the button via a href.

            1.1 User will insert username and password and get pushed to a new page

        2. Grab authorization code (i.e, code + state) fro the new page

        3. Put the authorization code (which already includes the state) in the second_url
        
                https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken?grant_type=authorization_code

                &client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID

                &client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

                &code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE

                &state=YOUR_STATE_NUM
                
                &redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI

        4. Push the user to the second url's page 

Part 2

        5. Grab the access_token that's provided on the browser of this page

        6. Put the access_token in the third_url: 

            https://api.linkedin.com/v2/me?

            oauth2_access_token=access_token 

        7. Push the user to the third url's page 
        

Part 3

        8. Access the json profile data from this page
        
        9. Display name and image on page
